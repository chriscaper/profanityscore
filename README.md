# profanityscore
This repository contains the assignment answer for AffinityAnswers

The degree of profanity refers to the extent of offensiveness in a given text. In context of this program, the degree of profanity expressed by counting the number of times a particular racial slur appears in a tweet. The higher the number of slurs, the higher the degree of profanity. The socre helps in determining how offensive a tweet is. 

For this assignment, I have implemented the assignment in Python.

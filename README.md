# profanityscore
This repository contains the assignment answer for AffinityAnswers

The degree of profanity refers to the extent of offensiveness in a given text. In context of this program, the degree of profanity expressed by counting the number of times a particular racial slur appears in a tweet. The higher the number of slurs, the higher the degree of profanity. The socre helps in determining how offensive a tweet is. 

For this assignment, I have implemented the assignment in Python.
The assumptions considered are:
1. The file is a plain text with one tweet per line. The text file only contains 50 tweets.
2. The slurs used in the program are a subset of the available racial/ethnic slurs from [the Wikipedia Page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs)
3. The program will determine the profanity score of each tweet by counting the number of occurrences of the racial slurs in the tweet.



- profanity_score.py -> consist of Python code
- tweets.txt -> contains list of 50 made-up tweets
